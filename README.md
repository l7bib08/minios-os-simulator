# MiniOS v1

MiniOS v1 is a **learning project** written in **C**, aimed at understanding the fundamentals of operating system development and low-level programming.

This project is not intended to be a full-featured operating system, but rather a hands-on way to explore how operating systems work from the ground up.

---

## Project Goals

- Learn the **C language** in a low-level context  
- Understand **operating system fundamentals**
- Explore concepts such as:
  - Boot process
  - Kernel basics
  - Memory management
  - Hardware interaction
- Build a minimal and simple OS step by step

---

## Technologies & Tools

- **C language**
- (Optional / Planned)
  - Assembly (for bootloader or low-level tasks)
  - GCC cross-compiler
  - QEMU or Bochs (for testing)
